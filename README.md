# Electron sample projects
Following Jake Trent's Electron Fundamentals course.

## Prerequisites
These projects are created with Node v8.9.1 and npm v5.5.1. You will need an up-to-date version of both Node and bpm in order to be able to run them. You can download both Node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The projects are offline by default.

## Deployment instructions
Electron apps are cross-platform, and the different application formats are built at deployment. The file extensions are .app for OSX, .exe for Windows and a non-extetion binary for Linux. 

The different icon formats for the platforms are .icox (OSX), .ico (Windows) and .png (Linux). These formats can be generated by an online format generator, for example [ICONVERT ICONS](https://iconverticons.com/online/). 

A great help for creating the packages is the [Electron Packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager) which can be installed by running ```npm install electron-packager```.

Add a script in the package.json-file of the project for ```"build": "electron-packager . --platform=darwin,win32,linux --arch=x64 --icon=app"```. When you now hit ```npm run build``` in the console, the app will be packaged for these 3 platforms in a 64-bit architecture. We also set the icon of the app to be the one named "icon" in the projects root folder.

The packages will be found in their own directories at the project root.
